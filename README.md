### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**TheAjinkya/TheAjinkya** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

  <ul>
      <li>ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on : Angular, React, TypeScript, Redux</li>
      <li>ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning : Everything about WEB</li>
      <li>ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on : NodeJS, React Projects</li>
      <li>ðŸ’¬ Ask me about : Angular & React</li>
      <li>ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/aajinkya/ </li>
      <li>âš¡ Fun fact: You can call me anytime, even at 2AM and I would pick up the call and would ask you in the morning! </li>
      </li>
    </ul>

I would like to show some of the code samples which I have created recently. Please have a look at that.
